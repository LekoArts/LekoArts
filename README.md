# Hi, I'm Lennart ðŸ‘‹

I'm a product-focused full stack engineer with years of experience in leading large-scale open source projects and shipping high-quality work to millions of users. Adept at building delightful, inclusive, and well-documented solutions to customers' needs. 

Previously I worked at [Clerk](https://clerk.com), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), and [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/).

I enjoy working on open source projects & making the web more inclusive through them. My [OSS code](https://github.com/LekoArts?tab=repositories&type=source) has been used by thousands of people & I regularly share educational content in the form of [posts](https://www.lekoarts.de/writing), [presentations](https://www.lekoarts.de/appearances), and [videos](https://www.lekoarts.de/appearances).

You can also find me on Bluesky at [@lekoarts.de](https://bsky.app/profile/lekoarts.de) or on Mastodon at <a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@lekoarts">mastodon.social/@lekoarts</a>.
