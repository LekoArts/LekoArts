# Hi, I'm Lennart ðŸ‘‹

I'm a designer turned software engineer from Darmstadt, Germany. I currently work at [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) on the open source software (OSS).

I'm passionate about working on open source projects & building thriving communities around them. My [OSS code](https://github.com/LekoArts) has been used by thousands of people & I regularly share educational content in the form of [posts](https://www.lekoarts.de/writing), [presentations](https://www.lekoarts.de/appearances), and [videos](https://www.lekoarts.de/appearances).

You can also find me on Twitter at [@lekoarts_de](https://twitter.com/lekoarts_de)
